# Rule Based Testing Framework for Java

### VERSION: Proof of Concept

This framework aims to enable developers to test their programs without needing to fully understand the code syntax.
A controller class reads rules from a test suite class and assembles the required code.

## Current Features

- Parsable rules include:
  - Static method calls with void or integer return types with public modifier
  - Integer static variables with public modifier
  - Expectations for integer values
- Controller reads rules and constructs test suites, then executes the generated test suites

## Installation

Current release is only Proof of Concept so there is currently no JAR available.

To install:
1. Download JAR file from this repository or clone it
2. Run the JAR from command line using the command:
`java -jar JavaRuleBasedTesting.jar <path to src folder of the project>`
3. Alternatively, add the JAR as an external library (eg: in IntelliJ or Eclipse IDEs)

## Usage

Runner is the main entrypoint into the program and will both generate and run the test suites. TestExecutor can be used for a previously generated test suite if no rules require extraction.

### Defining Rules

Rules can be defined simply, by either creating a method within the test case that returns the full set of rules or as a static instance variable containing the rules.

Method returning a string of rules (separated by `\n`):  
`public static String getRule() { return "<Rule Contents>"; }`


Instance variable containing the rules:  
`public static String rule = "<Rule Contents>";`

*NB: rules can be extracted using a String array type as well.*

Tests pass or fail using expectations. To add an expectation to a test, the rule should be of the form:
`Expect <variable name> to equal <expected value>`. The `<variable name>` can either be the value returned directly from a method or from a previously defined variable.

## Notes

Test classes containing rules must be stored in a `src/test/java` directory within the project. Java classes to be tested must be stored in a `src/main/java` directory.

Test suites that don't contain any rules and thus only require executing should be stored in a directory named 'generated' within the testing directory. Test suites generated by the program are also stored in the 'generated' directory.

Currently, the test suites cannot contain tests written using other libraries (eg: JUnit), as these cause problems when compiling Java files.
